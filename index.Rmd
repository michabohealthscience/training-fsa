## Introduction

The session focuses on a practical introduction to the calculation and interpretation of bioactivity similarity, with visual outputs (i.e. step 3 in the overall grouping workflow)

&nbsp;

The training will use existing code developed by Michabo Health Science Limited, and run within R (and R studio) which should be installed on the trainees local computer.

Working individually or in pairs, attendees will self-pace their progress through the training material and example data provided.




Data files will be available from a prior email or you can download from here

## R setup and local files



## Metabolomics 

This tutorial will be using metabolomics data however the same principals can (and have been) applied to other Omics data (i.e. transcripomics - ref Azo dye paper).

As a quick summary we are referring to the metabolome as the total collection of endogenous metabolites in a cell/tissue/organism. We refer to endogous metabolites being both xxx and lipid compounds.

todo - add Metabolomics figure summary.


A number of good overviews are available for this [ref 1], [ref 2]

## Training sections

The training will involve four stages

1. [Data processing](1_data_processing.html) - where an example Omics dataset will be introduced and pre-processed data will be imported into R. Using data from the Cefic MATCHING project [@viant2024demonstrating]
2. [Quality assessments](2_qa.html) - A breif note on quality assessments 
3. [Differentially abundant molecules - statistical analysis](3_stats.html) - Assess the bioactivity of the dataset and generate the input for the grouping
4. [Grouping](4_grouping.html)  - Where the univariate statistical results will be used to perform a grouping of test substances
5. [Unblinding!](5_unblinding.html) - Where we find out if our grouping matches the known mode of actions of our test substances
6. [Further details](6_more_info.html) - Further details for different parts of the workflow
