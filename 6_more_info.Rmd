# Data processing further details

In brief the following steps were performed:

1. Conversion of the RAW mass spectrometry files to open source mzML format. And centroiding the full profile of the raw data
2. Data reduction: Full scan (MS1) "peak picking", grouping and any rentiontion time correction performed by XCMS software
3. Feature intensity drift and/or batch correction
4. Identification and removal ("filtering") of features 
5. Identification and removal ("filtering") of outlying samples
6. Normalisation: Using PQN median samples as reference
7. Missing value imputation (for multivaraite analysis only)
9. glog transformations (for multivariate analysis only)


The full details of the data processing methods are found in the [supplemental of Cefic MATCHING publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10944399/bin/204_2024_3680_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) [@viant2024demonstrating].

The HILIC_POS assay for male rodents was used as an example for this practical with the following relevant data files for the training available on 
the github site:

* **HILIC_POS_male/0_sample_metadata.csv**  - Sample metadata prior to exclusion of any samples
* **HILIC_POS_male/0_sample_metadata_filtered.csv** - Sample metadata with any samples removed
* **HILIC_POS_male/0_feature_metadata.csv** - Feature metdata
* **HILIC_POS_male/1_unfiltered.csv** - unfiltered intensity matrix
* **HILIC_POS_male/2_filtered.csv** - filtered (both samples and features) intensity matrix
* **HILIC_POS_male/3_pqn.csv** - PQN normalised intensity matrix
* **HILIC_POS_male/4_mv_imputed.csv** - missing value imputed intensity matrix
* **HILIC_POS_male/5_glog.csv** - glog intensity matrix
