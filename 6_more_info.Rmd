# Data processing further details

The following steps were performed :

1. Conversion of the RAW mass spectrometry files to open source mzML format. And centroiding the full profile of the raw data
2. Data reduction: Full scan (MS1) "peak picking", grouping and any rentiontion time correction performed by XCMS software
3. Feature intensity drift and/or batch correction
4. Identification and removal ("filtering") of features 
5. Identification and removal ("filtering") of outlying samples
6. Normalisation: Using PQN median samples as reference (Dieterle et al. 2006)
7. Missing value imputation (for multivaraite analysis only)
9. glog transformations (for multivariate analysis only)

Noting that for multivariate analysis the methodology would tyically undergo an missing value imputation and glog transfromations in addition to the above. However, we won't be considering multivariate analysis on the intensity data for the analysis today.
