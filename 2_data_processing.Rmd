# Metabolomics data matrices

Metabolomics data is typically analysed as a matrix of **intensities** where one axis is for the **samples** that were analysed and the other for the **features**. Features being a specific *m/z* at a specific retention time.

The full data processing from raw mass spectrometry data to usable omics data matrix for grouping is beyond the scope 
of this tutorial. Instead we will work with a few key data matrices that have undergone standard metabolomics data processing.

In brief the following steps were performed:

1. **Data reduction** - Full scan (MS1) "peak picking", grouping and any retention time correction performed by XCMS software.
2. **QC assessment** - and removal of poor quality QCs.
3. **Xenobiotic metabolite filter** - remove metabolites that are either the test substance or biotransformation products of the test substance.
3. **Identification and removal of features** - blank filter and missing value filter by QC (â‰¥ 30% missing values in the QC samples are removed).
4. **Signal-drift and batch-effect correction** - to account for any signal drift or batch effects.
5. **Further identification and removal of features** - further filtering of features based on threshold of missing values and relative standard deviation of the features.
6. **Probabilistic Quotient Normalisation (PQN)** - accounts for dilution of complex biological mixtures.
7. **Missing value imputation** - using k nearest neighbour approach (for multivariate analysis only).
8. **Generalised logarithm transform (glog)** - variance-stabilising transformation that also reduces the weighting of very intense features in multivariate analysis so that they do not over-power less intense features that might still be significant (for multivariate analysis only)



The full details of the data processing methods are found in the [supplemental of Cefic MATCHING publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10944399/bin/204_2024_3680_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) [@viant2024demonstrating].

The HILIC_POS assay for male rodents was used as an example for this practical with the following relevant data files for the training available on 
the github site:


* **HILIC_POS_male/1_unfiltered.csv** - unfiltered intensity matrix
* **HILIC_POS_male/2_filtered.csv** - filtered (both samples and features) intensity matrix
* **HILIC_POS_male/3_pqn.csv** - PQN normalised intensity matrix
* **HILIC_POS_male/4_mv_imputed.csv** - missing value imputed intensity matrix
* **HILIC_POS_male/5_glog.csv** - glog intensity matrix




## Intensity data matrix


Let's start with the pre-filtering and pre-normalisation dataset and show what a typical metabolomics data matrix looks like.

```{r root_dir_url, echo=FALSE}
root <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michabohealthscience/training-fsa/main'
```


```{r root_dir, echo=FALSE}
root <- '.'
```

And let's read in the our first intensity matrix

```{r hilic_pos_intensity_unfiltered}
hilic_pos_all <- read.csv(file.path(root, 'data/HILIC_POS_male/1_unfiltered.csv'))
```

Again, `head` can be used for a quick check and `View` can be used to view in more detail.

The first column is a reference to the *m/z* and retention time of a feature and the columns are the samples.

Lets check how many samples and features we have for this data matrix. 

```{r hilic_pos_intensity_cols_rows, results = "hold"}
# feature count
feature_c_all = nrow(hilic_pos_all)
# sample count
samp_c_all = ncol(hilic_pos_all)-1

feature_c_all
samp_c_all

```

We can compare this to the filtered data matrix to see how many features have been removed due to the standard processing steps
```{r hilic_pos_intensity_filtered, results = "hold"}
hilic_pos_f <- read.csv(file.path(root, 'data/HILIC_POS_male/2_filtered.csv'))
```

For this dataset we should see that only 1 sample will be removed (the blank sample - as it is no longer required for further analysis) and substantial number of the metabolite features will have been removed that were deemed not suitable for further analysis.


```{r hilic_pos_intensity_filtered_cols_rows, results = "hold"}

# feature count
feature_c_f = nrow(hilic_pos_f)
# sample count
samp_c_f = ncol(hilic_pos_f)-1


c('All samples:', samp_c_all)
c('Samples removed:', samp_c_all-samp_c_f)
c('Remaining samples:', samp_c_f)

c('All features:', feature_c_all)
c('Features removed:', feature_c_all-feature_c_f)
c('remaining features:', feature_c_f)
```

Now that we have a better understanding of metabolomics data matrices we can briefly explain the quality assessments before getting started on the statistical analysis.
