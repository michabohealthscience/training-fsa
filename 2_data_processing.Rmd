# Metabolomics data matrices

Metabolomics data is typically analysed as a matrix of **intensities** where one axis is for the **samples** that were analysed and the other for the **features**. Features being a specific *m/z* at a specific retention time.

The full data processing from raw mass spectrometry data to usable omics data matrix for grouping is beyond the scope 
of this tutorial. Instead we will work with a few key data matrices that have undergone standard metabolomics data processing, see [More info](6_more_info.html) for the details of how the data has been processed.


## Intensity data matrix


Let's start with the pre-filtered and pre-normalisation dataset to show what a typical metabolomics data matrix looks like.

First setup the root URL or path if not already done so.

```{r root_dir_url}
root <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michabohealthscience/training-fsa/main'
```


```{r root_dir, echo=FALSE}
root <- '.'
```

And let's read in the our first intensity matrix

```{r hilic_pos_intensity_unfiltered}
hilic_pos_all <- read.csv(file.path(root, 'data/HILIC_POS_male/1_unfiltered.csv'))
```

Again, `head(hilic_pos_all)` can be used for a quick check and `View(hilic_pos_all)` can be used to view in more detail.

The first column is a reference to the *m/z* and retention time of a feature and the columns are the samples.

Lets check how many samples and features we have for this data matrix. 

```{r hilic_pos_intensity_cols_rows, results = "hold"}
# feature count
feature_c_all = nrow(hilic_pos_all)
# sample count
samp_c_all = ncol(hilic_pos_all)-1

feature_c_all
samp_c_all

```
We can compare this the the filtered data matrix to see how many features have been removed due to the standard processing steps
```{r hilic_pos_intensity_filtered, results = "hold"}
hilic_pos_f <- read.csv(file.path(root, 'data/HILIC_POS_male/2_filtered.csv'))
```

For this dataset we should see that only 1 sample will be removed (the blank sample - as it is no longer required for furher analysis) and substantial number of the metabolite features will have been removed that were deemed not suitable for further analysis.


```{r hilic_pos_intensity_filtered_cols_rows, results = "hold"}

# feature count
feature_c_f = nrow(hilic_pos_f)
# sample count
samp_c_f = ncol(hilic_pos_f)-1


c('All samples:', samp_c_all)
c('Samples removed:', samp_c_all-samp_c_f)
c('Remaining samples:', samp_c_f)

c('All features:', feature_c_all)
c('Features removed:', feature_c_all-feature_c_f)
c('remaining features:', feature_c_f)
```

Now that we have a better understanding of metabolomics data matrices we can briefly explain the quality assessments before getting started on the statistical analysis.
